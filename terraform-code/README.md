Chocoloatey is highly preferred way to work with PowerShell and all tools.
Recommendation is to follow 1st 2 steps from below and then use [Chocolatey Commands](#chocolatey-commands) as mentioned after this section.

Shall you still choose **NOT** to use Chocoloatey, manual links are mentioned from Sr. 3 onwards.

1. PowerShell 7 - Get latest stable release from: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases
2. Chocolatey - Run this command on PowerShell Administrative Prompt: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
3. Azure CLI - Get latest stable release from: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/releases
4. Terraform - Get latest stable release from: https://www.terraform.io/downloads
5. kubectl - Follow guide at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
6. MySQL CLI - Get latest stable release from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/
7. Helm Charts - Follow guide at: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

# Chocolatey Commands

2. Terraform: `choco install terraform`
3. kubectl: `choco install kubernetes-cli`
4. MySQL CLI: `choco install mysql-cli`
5. Helm: `choco install kubernetes-helm`

# Logging on to Azure

# Terraform State

Terraform state file is been managed inside a storage account blob container 

resource_group_name  = "test-rg"           # Replace with your resource group name
storage_account_name = "2bcloudtestsa"     # Replace with your storage account name
container_name       = "terraform-state" # Replace with your desired container name
key                  = "terraform.tfstate" # Optional: Specify the filename within the container (defaults to 'terraform.tfstate')

Note: Storage Account "2bcloudtestsa" is manually created on portal to managed statefile configuration on azure

# Terraform Provider

terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.3"
  
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"

    }
  }
}
